Some way old tests, done in a style no longer supported.
BTW "no longer supported" means they also won't run (due to import changes, etc).

We keep them around because when they did work they tested some interesting 
corner cases in the gateway functionaity, e.g. with regard to Queens addresses,
which we may want to recover (and integrate wholistically into the newer style
of doing things), some day.
