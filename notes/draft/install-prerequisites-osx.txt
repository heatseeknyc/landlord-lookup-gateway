uWSGI
=====

    sudo pip install uwsgi

If you're in an Anaconda environment, the uwsgi executable will be installed in the same location as your Python interpreter.

ngnix + pcre
============

Apparently one needs to build these in tandem (as the make process for nginx apparently does a "hard" make on the pcre dist):

    mkdir /build/nginx
    mkdir /build/pcre

    cd /build/pcre
    curl --remote-name ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/pcre-8.39.tar.gz
    tar -xvof pcre-8.39.tar.gz 

Get the tarball for nginx somehow, and:

    cd /build/nginx
    tar -xvof nginx-1.10.3.tar.gz 
    ./configure --with-pcre=/build/pcre/pcre-8.39
    make
    sudo make install

Which by default will install to /usr/local/nginx.  Note however we won't be using the global configuration files to run the gateway ...

See the note 'deploy-and-start-services.rst'.
