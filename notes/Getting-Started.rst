===========

Ubuntu or OS X host, with superuser priveleges.  Or you have some other kind of host, and the knowledge to adapt these instructions to its peculiarities. 

Basic familiarity with uWSGI and nginx, or the ability to brush up on it quickly.  Caveat: In principle this shouldn't be difficult - but in practice we find that the web is cluttered with less-than-precisely articulated (or simply out of data / version-specific) information, particular in regard to examples of basic setup configurations.  In any case considerable effort was taken to get our configuration files "just right".
