(1) Edit config/postgres.json, and make sure the "database" field points to the database instance we'll be using and "password" field corresponds to the readuser password. 

(1b) htpasswd?

(2) Edit config/nycgeo.json, which once pulled from the repo, probably looks about like this:

  {
    "siteurl" : "https://api.cityofnewyork.us",
    "app_key" : "APP_KEY_NOT_SET", 
    "app_id"  : "APP_ID_NOT_SET"
  }

And paste in your key/id pair in the slots provided.
